### 8. How to switch branch on git
If you want to switch to an existing branch, you can use 'git checkout' command and pass the name of the branch you want to switch to.
```bash
$ git checkout feature

output - Switched to branch 'feature'
```
If you want to switch to a non-existing branch, you will need to use the -b option. It will first create a new branch and then switch to that branch.
```bash
$ git checkout -b bug-fixes

output - Switched to a new branch 'bug-fixes'
```

### 9. How can you delete a branch both locally and remotely
Git won't let you delete the branch you're currently on, so you'll need to switch to another branch before deleting the one you want to delete.

****Delete a branch locally****
```bash
$ git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>
```
****Delete a branch remotely****
```bash
$ git push <remote_name> --delete <BRANCH_NAME>

              OR
              
$ git push <remote_name> :<BRANCH_NAME>
```
